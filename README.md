# Developing Zen - the CoderDojo Community Platform

To develop Zen there are several possibilities to setup the platform:

- [Set it up manually on your computer](https://github.com/CoderDojo/cp-local-development#community-platform-zen-local-development).
- Use the [install scripts](native) to install it on your computer.
- Use the [docker scripts](docker) to install it in a docker environment.
